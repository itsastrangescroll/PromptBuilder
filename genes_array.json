In many African traditions, carved wooden masks and costumes are worn over the face or other body parts in rituals and performances, sometimes transforming the wearer into a spiritual conduit. European Modernists, such as [Pablo Picasso](https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso), looked to African masks as touchstones for abstracted and stylized human figures; this connection is most explicit in the mask-inspired faces of Picasso’s Les Demoiselles D’avignon (1907). In the last decade many artists have used the form of the mask as a vehicle for cultural commentary, as in Liu Bolin’s re-creation of Peking Opera masks using junk-food packaging and advertisements, or Mozambican artist [Goncalo Mabunda](https://www.artsy.net/artist/goncalo-mabunda)’s mask-like sculptures, which incorporate arms recovered from his country’s recent civil war to comment on the disruptive power of violence on cultural traditions."

(Previously, the Western usage of the term largely referred to drawing or the overall look of a composition or object.) Importantly, design is often used in combination with the term decorative arts, a preferred term for describing pre-19th century (and pre-industrial revolution) functional objects. Among the many historical design movements—to have contributed significant design forms to the canon or challenged the role of functional objects in daily life—are the [Arts and Crafts Movement](/gene/arts-and-crafts-movement), the Deutscher Werkbund, and the [Bauhaus](/gene/bauhaus)."

Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.”_ —Coco Chanel\n\nHumans have produced clothing for as far back as archeologists can trace, but the modern fashion industry, with its labels, magazines, and the imperative of style, emerged in the late 18th century, primarily as haute couture (“high fashion”). In the 20th century, enabled by the rise of consumer culture and technologies of mass production like the sewing machine, factory-made prêt-à-porter (“ready to wear”) brought fashion into everyday life. Due to the reliance of fashion on commerce and its predominant association with women, its status as an art form worthy of serious scholarly attention has long been debated by art historians. Clothing designers have used fashion to creatively push the boundaries of issues from beauty to gender roles—in the avant-garde designs of [Alexander McQueen](/artist/alexander-mcqueen), or the provocative garments of [Jean Paul Gaultier](/artist/jean-paul-gaultier), for example. Many visual artists create wearable art, often to engage audiences in novel ways: see [Nick Cave’s soundsuits](/artwork/nick-cave-soundsuit-2), Atsuko _Tanaka’s Electric Dress_ (1956), or Zhang Huan’s performance _My New York_ (2002), in which the artist navigated Manhattan dressed in a suit of meat."

    "description": "Graphic design is the use of text and images to convey a concept or a message. The term “graphic designer” was coined by William Addison Dwiggins in 1922, a time when posters and advertising were evolving from being primarily informative to serving more graphic and aesthetic purposes. Notable highlights of this transition include the late 19th-century movement [Art Nouveau](/gene/art-nouveau), including [posters](/gene/poster) by [Alphonse Mucha](/artist/alphonse-mucha) and [Jules Chéret](/artist/jules-cheret) that aimed to create a new aesthetic for the Industrial Age filled with sinuous forms and ornate typography. While graphic design today is more commonly considered a commercial activity, in the early 20th century it was closely aligned with fine art, especially in the journals of avant-garde artists (for example, [Filippo Tommaso Marinetti](/artist/filippo-tommaso-marinetti)’s Futurist publications, Tristan Tzara’s Dada, [Theo Van Doesburg](/artist/theo-van-doesburg-1)’s Stijl, and [Kurt Schwitters](/artist/kurt-schwitters)’s Merz). These experiments helped pave the way for the clarity, legibility, and dominant planes of bright colors typical of the International Typographic Style (or Swiss Style), developed in the 1950s. This aesthetic permeates advertising and logo design today, from Adidas’s striking three-bar logo to IBM’s three simple letters. The accessibility of ever-evolving digital tools has dramatically democratized the field of graphic design and opened a new platform for the discipline: designing for the web."

As the empire's official religion was Orthodox Christianity, Byzantine art was largely devotional, [Christian art](/artsy/gene/gene/christian-art-and-architecture). Perhaps the best known example of Byzantine art is a tenth-century [mosaic](/artwork/byzantine-hagia-sophia-istanbul-turkey-madonna-and-child-flanked-by-emperor-justinian) of the [Virgin Mary](/tag/the-virgin-mary) in the [Hagia Sophia](/artwork/anthemius-of-tralles-and-isidorus-of-miletus-hagia-sophia) in Istanbul that demonstrates the stylized forms, sharp contours, flat fields of color, and gold mosaic the period is known for. Byzantine icons of Mary (icons were traditional wood panels that included portraits or stories of holy figures, meant for veneration) set a benchmark for Christian art far and wide: in the 13th and 14th centuries Italian artists drawing on Byzantine icons, exemplified by [Giotto](/artist/giotto-giotto-di-bondone)’s [_Madonna and Child_](/artwork/giotto-giotto-di-bondone-madonna-and-child), launched the birth of panel painting, a format that became central to Western art making.

Though incredibly diverse across regions and time periods, there are two generally recognized types of Aboriginal art: figurative and geometric (though these two styles can often be combined). These works in certain contexts carry understood meanings—geometric designs, for example, are variously believed to have been imparted by ancestors. The artist plays a significant role in traditional Aboriginal society, as artworks are seen as sacred forms of religious knowledge. What is widely understood as Contemporary Aboriginal Art has its roots in an art teacher named Geoffrey Bardon, who in 1971 gave art materials to a group of Aboriginal men in Papunya; when it sparked their interest, he worked with 11 men to form a cooperative, the Papunya Tula Artists, which has since grown to include 60 artists nationwide. Known for its complex abstractions of dots and lines in earth tones, Contemporary Aboriginal is arguably the most significant strand of Australian art today."

As the ideas and practices of Christianity have changed and developed over the past nearly two thousand years, so too has the artistic expression surrounding it.

Greek Art’s [Geometric period](/tag/geometric-period) is characterized by geometric designs and stylized [figures](/gene/silhouettes) painted on the bodies of pottery [vessels](/gene/vessel). Beginning in the seventh century BCE, the Archaic period witnessed the introduction of the human marble statuary as a vehicle for the production of images of idealized youth, known as the [kouros](/tag/kouros) and [kore](/tag/kore). During the Classical period, artists further refined sculptures of the human figure to reflect a canon of ideal beauty: [Praxiteles](/artist/praxiteles)’s _[Aphrodite of Knidos](/artwork/praxiteles-aphrodite-of-knidos-greco-roman-variant-on-the-original-marble-of-ca-350-bc)_ would become one of the Greek statues most reproduced in the Hellenistic period and later by the Romans, who heavily copied and emulated Greek artworks and styles. While one trend within Hellenistic art adhered to the idealism of Classical models, another involved a shift to depictions of [human drama](/artwork/dying-gaul-gallic-trumpeter-from-commemorative-group-at-pergamum-in-asia-minor-1) and genre-like figures. Greek architecture reached its apogee in the so-called golden century of Pericles at the height of Athenian democracy, with the creation of the [Parthenon](/artwork/kallikrates-and-iktinos-parthenon-acropolis), a temple in honor of goddess [Athena](/tag/athena) (built by [Kallikrates and Iktinos](/artist/kallikrates-and-iktinos) between 447 to 432 BCE).

In cities such as Tikal, Chichén Itzá, and Tulum (each of which was prominent at a different time), the Mayan people developed architectural forms, such as the pyramid temple and the palace, that employed [masonry construction](/gene/masonry-construction) and were at times adorned with [mosaics](/gene/mosaics). Other developments in Mayan culture included a shared calendar system, the mythological narratives and iconography of the Popol Vuh text, and various instruments used for personal and communal religious functions. The last major Mayan confederacy collapsed as a result of infighting around 1450. Because centralization in Mayan territories was absent, the Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula was met with over two decades of local resistance before colonial control was solidified in 1546. Nevertheless, pockets of Guatemala remained under Mayan control throughout the 17th century, and Mayan language and customs persist in the region today."

While Islam shares the prophetic tradition of Judaism and Christianity, the monotheistic religion has its own tenets and rituals, such as the belief in Allah as the one god and Muhammad as his prophet, daily prayer, charity, fasting during Ramadan, and, if possible, a pilgrimage to Mecca. However, Islamic art is difficult to define: not all Islamic art is religious, and not all artists who created it were Muslim. Islamic art includes [architecture](/gene/architecture-1), [calligraphy](/gene/arabic-slash-farsi-calligraphy), decorative arts ([carpets](/artwork/turkey-ottoman-prayer-rug), ceramics, and metalware, among other examples), and [painting](/gene/painting) and stems from territories as diverse as the Arab world: Iranian lands, Turkey, India, China, and Spain. Early instances of Islamic art combined elements from existing traditions within [Greco-Roman](/gene/greek-and-roman-art-and-architecture), [Byzantine](/gene/byzantine-art), and Sasanian art, as exemplified by [The Dome of the Rock](/artwork/the-dome-of-the-rock-interior-view) in Jerusalem. Over time, Islamic art developed a unique artistic language whose hallmarks included all-over decoration and the use of vegetal and geometric patterns, such as the [Arabesque](/gene/arabesque-slash-scroll), among other forms. As writing is highly valued in Islam, calligraphy is ubiquitous, serving as decoration for objects and buildings. Additionally, while figuration is found in secular examples of Islamic Art, it is absent from religious works, in which the depiction of the human form is considered idolatry. While maintaining common elements, Islamic art across the globe is highly diverse, linking the [Alhambra Palace](/artwork/granada-spain-alhambra) in Granada, Spain, to the [Taj Mahal](/artwork/agra-india-mughal-period-taj-mahal) in India."

Hinduism’s visual tradition encompasses both mythological and secular themes, narrating the religion’s goals for life on earth: achieving spiritual salvation (_moksha_), righteous living (_dharma_), love (_kama_), and prosperity (_artha_). Over centuries, Hindu temple structures have evolved from rock caves carved into cliffs to large monuments with symbolically multifaceted spaces. As cultural traditions changed rapidly in the late 19th century, artist Ravi Varma pioneered the use of color lithography to mass-produce his Western-influenced paintings of Hindu deities, subjects that contemporary Indian painter [Manjit Bawa](/artist/manjit-bawa) also later depicted, referring to them as “icons of my country.”"

The [Maya](/gene/mayan-art-and-architecture) left behind pyramids, stone sculpture, and hieroglyphic writing in cities in the [Yucatan](/artwork/itza-northern-maya-yucatan-mexico-pyramid-el-castillo-chichen-itza) such as [Palenque](/artwork/maya-culture-palenque-mexico-palace-and-temple-of-the-inscriptions-tomb-pyramid-of-lord-pakal), but these were largely wiped out by the [Aztec](/gene/aztec-art) Empire in the 12th century. The Aztecs also created immense religious and royal structures at their capital, Tenochtitlán, built in the middle of a lake in central Mexico. Empires in the Andes constructed large complexes as well, such as the massive desert drawings the [Nazca](/artwork/nazca-culture-earth-drawing-geoglyph-of-a-hummingbird-nazca-plain) created in southern Peru and the mountaintop citadel [Machu Picchu](/tag/images-of-machu-picchu), built by the Inca. These civilizations were overtaken by European conquistadors at the beginning of the 16th century, but elements of Pre-Columbian language and culture survive throughout the Americas up to the present day. Due to what has been seen as a Eurocentric bias to the terms “pre-Columbian” and its synonym “pre-Hispanic,” the terms Ancient American, pre-contact, pre-conquest, and precolumbian (with Columbus de-emphasized) are commonly used."

    "description": "The art and architecture of ancient Greece and Rome played a foundational role of the history of Western art, establishing numerous key concepts, techniques, and styles that artists in the subsequent millennia have revisited and responded to in countless ways. These include precise techniques for carving and casting free-standing sculptures and the undertaking of large-scale urban building projects, which stemmed from access to and the skilled use of materials ranging from marble to bronze to concrete. “Man is the measure of all things” was a central maxim in Greek culture, and as such, Greek artists scrutinized human forms closely to create idealized Classical figures. They also presented detailed depictions of mythological narratives, which often accentuated the human traits of the pantheon of gods. Roman artists borrowed heavily from these narratives, while contributing many of their own. These developments in art were accompanied by new forms of political life, most notably the form of democracy that emerged in Athens and reached its height during the 5th century BC (the Parthenon was built 447-432 BC). Athens and its neighbors in the eastern Mediterranean participated in a seafaring culture that resulted in a great amount of cultural and economic exchange. Under the Roman Empire (27 BC-395 AD), territories stretching from the present-day Middle East to Scotland were brought under centralized rule. Beginning in the 4th century, cultural and political power shifted to the east of the empire, with Constantinople becoming the capital in 330 and much of the western territory falling into the hands of northern European conquerors thereafter. Around this time, Christianity began to supplant pagan religion—at first persecuted by the state but in the 4th century becoming the official religion under Constantine, which led to the growth of a new body of iconography that would flourish in [Byzantine Art](/gene/byzantine-art)."

After centuries of being relegated to ethnological displays and curio cabinets, traditional African art entered into the European consciousness (and museums) as “art” at the turn of the 20th century, in part through its association with the European avant-garde. European modernists admired the aesthetics of what they called “Primitive Art,” a designation that conflated African art with [traditional Oceanic](/gene/traditional-oceanic-art) and [pre-Columbian art](/gene/pre-columbian-art), reflecting the racial and cultural bias against non-White, non-Western cultures at the time. In the 1960s and 1970s, when the study of African art in Europe and America took a scientific and anthropological turn, the term “Tribal Art” was considered preferable to the derogatory connotations of “primitive.” While “Tribal Art” is still used by some experts and collectors today, others reject it for failing to treat African art distinctly. The term “Traditional African Art,” though still problematic for its reductive grouping of diverse cultures under one geographic umbrella, is generally favored today."

Since concrete can be poured and metal can be bent into any shape, many architects have taken advantage of this versatile and cost-effective material to construct complex structures. Beginning in the early 20th century, the Belgian architect Auguste Perret (with the help of his brothers, Gustave and Claude) built the world’s first reinforced concrete apartment block at 25 rue Franklin, in Paris. The unparalleled strength of reinforced concrete meant that fewer structural supports were needed, which allowed Perret to use large windows on the facade to let in more light and to create more open space on each floor. Many iconic buildings of the 20th and 21st centuries have since been built using reinforced concrete construction, including [Frank Lloyd Wright](/artist/frank-lloyd/wright)’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York; [Le Corbusier](/artist/le-corbusier)’s Villa Savoye, in Paris; and the Burj Khalifa (currently the world’s tallest building), in Dubai."

The industrial revolution, beginning in the late 18th century, introduced increasingly complex machinery that fundamentally altered the production, circulation, and consumption of goods. Throughout the mid-20th century, material innovations, the inventive repurposing of World War II manufacturing processes, and an ethos of collaboration among artists and designers yielded a high point in design history. For example, the bent plywood technique used in Charles and Ray Eames’s [iconic chair](/artwork/charles-and-ray-eames-lounge-chair-and-ottoman-2) originated in a leg splint they designed for the Navy. Designers used methods of ethnography, anthropology, anthropometry, ergonomics, and the study of the body and movement to bring human-centered design to the masses (Henry Dreyfuss’s 1937 [Model 203 Telephone](/artwork/henry-dreyfuss-model-302-telephone) was the first to enable hands-free calling; [Dieter Rams](/artist/dieter-rams)’s 1987 Braun calculator influenced the look of the iPhone’s calculator). After World War II, increased purchasing power in the United States and Europe contributed to the flourishing of designing for human needs, while the development of computing technology in the later 20th century has led to innovations in product design, particularly responsive user interfaces."

Additionally, many Brutalist structures' functional components (such as water tanks, electrical towers, and support pillars) are left exposed on the outside of the building. As an architectural philosophy, Brutalism was often associated with utopian socialist ideology. Completed in 1952, Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse—a public housing complex in Marseille that was built under the premise that each resident should have the same amount of space and equal access to sunlight—is often cited as the initial inspiration for the Brutalist style. Criticism of the style centers around its cold appearance.

[Robert Venturi](/artist/robert-venturi), one of the most prominent Postmodernist architects, wrote two books that were instrumental in defining the movement: _Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture_ (1966) and _Learning from Las Vegas_ (1972). In the former, Venturi argued that Modernism, in its search for “purity” through use of minimal materials and a functionally driven aesthetic, was reductive, calling instead for the return of wit, ornament, and historical reference. Other prominent architects and designers associated with Postmodernism include [Frank Gehry](/artist/frank-gehry), [Ettore Sottsass](/artist/ettore-sottsass), and [Phillip Johnson](/artist/philip-johnson). In their work, the functional and formalized shapes and spaces of the Modernist style are replaced by diverse aesthetics: styles collide, form is adopted for its own sake, and new ways of viewing familiar styles and spaces abound."

Toward the end of the 19th century, the rolltop desk became a popular means to handle the massive increase in paper that was dealt with by workers on a daily basis. At the beginning of the [20th century](/gene/20th-century-art), steel desks were introduced to handle the weight of typewriters. The invention of the desktop computer led to the addition of trays for keyboards and design solutions for managing power cords and peripherals like printers."

Throughout human history, an almost infinite variety of approaches have been taken to design and fashion the appearance of seating. While complexly designed chairs date to as early as ancient Egyptian and Greek cultures, formal seating (for example, a chair as opposed to a bench or stool) was rarely used by ordinary people in Western Europe until the 16th century. Importantly, not all cultures prioritize chairs or any type of constructed seating. For example, prior to the 20th century, Japan had a long history of sitting on the floor."

During the colonial era (ca. 1500–1800), Latin American Art was often religious and resembled the style of painting practiced in Europe’s academies of fine art. In the 1800s, however, in response to independence movements, artists like José Gil de Castro, in Peru, and Francisco Oller, in Puerto Rico, helped contribute to the development of original Latin American regional styles. The tension between indigenous peoples and European influence continued into the 20th century, reflected by movements like [Mexican Muralism](/gene/mexican-muralism) and the Anthropophagic movement of [Tarsila do Amaral](/artist/tarsila-do-amaral) in 1920s Brazil. Antropófago (its Portuguese name) proposed that Brazil’s greatest strength was its “cannibalization” of other cultures, embracing it as a method of asserting dominance and independence.

By 200 BCE, the invention of tiny square tiles called “tesserae” allowed [Greek](/gene/greek-art-and-architecture) artisans to create highly detailed mosaics that rivaled the clarity of painting.

While mosaic was reserved for religious spaces for much of its history, modern and contemporary artists like [Antoni Gaudí](/artist/antoni-gaudi) and [Niki de Saint Phalle](/artist/niki-de-saint-phalle) have brought this medium to public spaces by adorning parks and city walls with playful ceramic tiles."

The period of widespread use of Bronze throughout Europe, from around 2500 and 800 B.C., has been coined \"the Bronze age.\" In Greece around the 7th Century B.C., new casting techniques allowed for the creation of a large number of highly detailed, life-size sculptures, a tradition that was passed on to Rome. These developments paved the way for iconic works such as [Lorenzo Ghiberti](/artist/lorenzo-ghiberti)'s doors for the Florence Baptistry, [Donatello](/artist/donatello)'s _David_ (1440), and then the works of [Auguste Rodin](/artist/auguste-rodin), [Constantin Brancusi](/artist/constantin-brancusi), [Alberto Giacometti](/artist/constantin-brancusi), [Fernando Botero](/artist/fernando-botero), and [Louise Bourgeois](/artist/louise-bourgeois).

Since, ceramics have evolved into an increasingly complex, versatile art form. Interrogating the boundaries of sculpture, form, and function, ceramics encompass a myriad of techniques and styles, such as Japanese raku, wheel-throwing, slab construction, and hand-forming, as well as various clay types including terracotta, stoneware, and porcelain.

Strong, cheaper than traditional stone, and easily transportable, concrete is made by combining water with an aggregate (such as small pieces of stones or brick) and a binder (such as lime or cement) and then allowing the malleable mass to harden; it is often reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to increase its tensile strength. Underutilized for centuries after the classical period, it became a mainstay of modern architecture and infrastructure. It has been used to construct both masterpieces of aesthetic innovation, such as Le Corbusier’s [_Notre Dame du Haut_](/artwork/le-corbusier-chapelle-de-notre-dame-du-haut-ronchamp-france), and the massive housing blocks and anonymous, utilitarian structures that fueled 20th-century urbanization.

Combining materials—especially those associated with different mediums, such as painting and sculpture–is closely associated with a number of important developments in Modern art. [Cubist](/gene/cubism) collages, [Marcel Duchamp](/artist/marcel-duchamp)'s readymades, and [Dada](/gene/dada) assemblage formed key precedents for later generations working in mixed-media. Notably, [Robert Rauschenberg](/artist/robert-rauschenberg) and [Jasper Johns](/artist/jasper-johns)—commonly associated with [Neo-Dada](/gene/neo-dada)—were instrumental in including different media on the painted canvas in the 1950s and '60s. [Installation](/gene/installation), which emerged in the 1960s, continues to be a major practice in contemporary art and often includes a range of media. Central to many contemporary mixed-media works is the inclusion of materials that fall far outside the accepted mediums of art; a commonly-cited example is [Damien Hirst](/artist/damien-hirst)'s provocative use of dead animals in his sculptures."

Though long a popular pastime amongst scrapbookers, the technique’s art-historical beginnings are generally traced back to one of its earliest appearances in Western art: Pablo Picasso’s [_Still Life with Chair Caning_](/artwork/pablo-picasso-still-life-with-chair-caning) of 1912, which incorporated real-life objects into a work of art for the first time. In the collage, a printed oilcloth simulated chair caning and a piece of rope functioned as both a frame and the border of a café table. Collage was an assault on painting and its proposal of imaginary space as well as the proper materials of art. For example, [Kurt Schwitters](/artist/kurt-schwitters)' collages and assemblages brought the detritus of street life and modern life's [printed ephemera](/gene/printed-matter)—ticket stubs, newspapers, postage stamps—into the realm of high art. The development of collage in art ran parallel to experiments in poetry and literature in the early 20th century, where aesthetic principles of fragmentation, reassembly, and multiple meanings reflected the rapid societal and technological changes ushered in by modernism and urbanization."

However, in Europe, artists like [Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter) and [Franz Gertsch](artist/franz-gertsch) have likewise been referred to as photorealists, but for a different reason: the hazy quality and unexpected angles in their candid portraits resemble casual, often blurred snapshots. Today, artists who emulate the look of photographs make work in both ways (and in between), and as a result, push the boundaries of what constitutes a photorealistic image. Is it the crisp, extreme focus of a well-lit photograph, or the imitation of poor, faded, or murky photographic scenes?"

Woodcut is the oldest printmaking technique, originating in China and reaching the West in the 13th century; the linocut was invented in the late 19th century. The bold mark of a woodcut and the (often apparent) wood grain impression contrasts the more fluid mark of the linocut. During the 15th century, German artist [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) mastered the technique of carving into wood, finessing the vigorous woodcut mark into articulated fine lines; centuries later, [Expressionists](/gene/austrian-and-german-expressionism) like [Ernst Ludwig Kirchner](/artist/ernst-ludwig-kirchner) and [Emil Nolde](/artist/emil-nolde) would revive the German woodcut tradition, exploring the medium’s graphic potential with more aggressive marks and flat planes of color.

Historically, until the broad use of color photography, documentary photography was black and white and captured events with precise focus, limited distortions, and minimal darkroom editing, with the understanding that to manipulate was to distort the truth. It also has characteristically carried a social imperative: to expose what life is like truthfully—in cities, in poverty, in disasters—and to encourage societal progress. Accordingly, some of the best-known historical documentary photographers were also heavily involved in activist causes against poverty and child labor, such as [Jacob Riis](/artist/jacob-august-riis) and [Lewis Hine](/artist/lewis-wickes-hine).

It also has a long history in East Asian ink-and-wash painting. Gestural qualities came to the forefront as painting moved towards abstraction in the early 20th century, in part as a means of distinguishing itself from photography; this can be seen in works by [Austrian and German Expressionists](/gene/austrian-and-german-expressionism), as well as in the Cubism of [Georges Braque](/artist/georges-braque).

Many are never executed in their larger form, but can be appreciated as stand-alone works. Most often made of clay, wood, plaster and wax, maquettes also can serve an important historical function, revealing different stages in the design process that lead up to a finished work, or providing information about the form of an object that no longer exists. Some are highly polished while others evidence a rough construction, as in the terracotta models used by the eighteenth-century French sculptor [Antonio Canova](/artist/antonio-canova) in preparing for his larger marble works. Modern artists including [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) challenged the provisional status of the maquette by executing finished works in a rough maquette-like technique—for example, in _Cirque Calder_ (1926–31), [Alexander Calder](/artist/alexander-calder) performed a cast of wire-sculpted characters and miniature circus props."

[Jean Arp](/artist/jean-arp) composed collages by dropping shapes at random while [Marcel Duchamp](/artist/marcel-duchamp) recorded the patterns formed by dropped strings; both diminished the status of the artist's conscious decisions in creating an artwork. Explorations of chance and the potential of the unconscious were central to both [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism) as well artists of later generations, like the [Abstract Expressionists](/gene/abstract-expressionism). [Ellsworth Kelly](/artist/ellsworth-kelly), for one, is well-known for choosing the colors for his grid paintings by rolling dice. The 1960s [Happenings](/gene/happenings) associated with [Fluxus](/gene/fluxus) and others introduced a new element of chance into art-making, with [John Cage](/artist/john-cage) famously using flipped coins as a means of composing musical scores."

Because of its durability, encaustic was most likely first used by the Greeks in order to waterproof and decorate ships, but eventually found its way into more traditional forms of art. After the fall of the Byzantine empire, where the medium appears in many religious icons, encaustic largely disappeared until the 18th century when it was used by artists trying to imitate Greek and Roman Art. In the 20th century, encaustic is most often associated with the work of [Jasper Johns](/artist/jasper-johns), who used it in his Flag paintings, the first of which was displayed in 1955.

For the first aerial photograph in 1858, French photographer [Félix Nadar](/artist/felix-nadar) had to solve the problem of the existing \"wet plate\" technology for photographs, which required processing within 20 minutes; he built a portable dark-room and, with it, flew over rural France in a hot air balloon. Luckily for today's photographers, airplanes, helicopters, and tall towers offer ample (and safer) opportunity to photograph the ground below. But the aerial view has continued to evince excitement: In 1928 [Laszlo-Moholy Nagy](/artist/laszlo-moholy-nagy) produced an iconic image of the ground from Berlin's Radio Tower, and contemporary Italian photographer [Olivo Barbieri](/artist/olivo-barbieri) takes the bird's eye view to new heights."

Variations on this practice have existed around the world, with early instances including ancient Egyptian papyrus painting, ancient Chinese silk painting, and medieval manuscripts. Greater standardization in watercolor production was furthered by the wide distribution of a list of usable pigments in 17th-century England and the invention of portable watercolor boxes in the early 18th century. Old Masters like [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) and [Sir Anthony Van Dyck](/artist/sir-anthony-van-dyck) used the medium primarily for landscapes, though often as a delicate accent in ink and chalk drawings. Watercolor gained its strongest standing in the United Kingdom, with watercolorists gaining admission to the Royal Academy by the end of the 18th century and [J. M. W. Turner](/artist/joseph-mallord-william-turner) adopting it as a preferred medium. While less admired in continental Europe, the signature Impressionist styles of [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne) and [Camille Pissarro](/artist/camille-pissarro) were both greatly indebted to the medium.

The prophet Muhummad's revelations, which were recorded as the contents of the Qu'ran, occurred in the early part of the 7th century. During the spread of Islam in subsequent centuries, a legible script printed on parchment was essential for transporting and sharing the Qu'ran. In the 9th century, paper became the preferred medium, which led to the development of a more fluid, cursive script in place of the more angular style of the past; paper permitted not only the spread of religious texts, but also the publishing of large numbers of secular books. Farsi calligraphy reached its height around 1400 AD and was regularly used for poetry. While Arabic continued to be the language of sacred texts, Farsi was considered the language of highest literary merit, even as far away as the Ottoman and Mughal empires (present-day Turkey and India, respectively). Images of God were forbidden by the Qu'ran, and figurative art was often suspected of idolatry, so calligraphy is amongst the highest art forms in the Muslim world. Contemporary uses of calligraphy can be found in [Ghada Amer](/artist/ghada-amer)'s sculptures, [Shirin Neshat](/artist/shirin-neshat-2)'s photography, and [Shahzia Sikhander](/artist/shahzia-sikander)'s drawings and paintings."

    "description": "Most likely derived from the decoration of metal armor in Northern Europe during the 15th century, etching and engraving are the two major intaglio printmaking techniques. Though they produce visually similar results, etching involves incising a wax-coated metal plate with a sharp tool and placing the plate into an acid bath. The acid corrodes the exposed lines, leaving the waxy ground unaffected; the plate is then inked and printed, forcing the paper into the incised lines. Considered one of the great masters of the technique, [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn) harnessed the medium’s similarity to drawing with a pencil or pen. Engraving, the oldest intaglio technique and the most common method seen in Old Master prints, involves directly incising a metal matrix and then printing. Engraving arguably reached its pinnacle with [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer), who mastered the technique's precise and tapered lines to achieve great tonality as seen in [this print](artwork/albrecht-durer-st-anthony)."

However, this is a relatively recent development; although early experiments with various photosensitive chemicals began in the 1840s shortly after photography’s birth, it was not until the 1890s that such chemical processes were successfully applied to the production of color film, and only a few early experimenters—mostly amateur scientists or intrepid travelers—used the medium to capture nature, cultural sites, or the occasional sitter. And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand. In art, the delay took even longer; the watershed moment was [William Eggleston](/artist/william-eggleston)’s exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1976—the first major museum exhibition of color photography.

Other CAM processes include subtractive techniques, in which material is removed from a large starting block (usually of wood or metal) until the digitally designed form is achieved. The two most common types of this technique are CNC routing and milling. Both use a movable rotating cutter guided by digital instructions that cut into and carve a starting block of material.

Inspired by the painted trays traditionally presented to pregnant women, these tondi often depicted [Bible stories](/gene/bible-story) and images of the [Madonna and Child](/gene/madonna-and-child). The round panel or canvas put forth an alternate set of compositional concerns from those established by [Leon Battista Alberti](/artist/leon-battista-alberti), who wrote that rectangular painting is essential for pictorial perspective. Abstract and figurative painters in various movements since have used the tondo to complement their work on rectangular canvases, from [Caravaggio](/artist/michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio) to [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso), [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock), and [Sol LeWitt](/artist/sol-lewitt)."

    "description": "Though the term literally means any mixture of pigment and medium (the two basic parts of any paint), tempera primarily refers to egg tempera, a kind of paint used since antiquity in which egg is the binding medium for the pigment. Egg tempera was used to paint Greek and Roman Orthodox icons as well as many of 15th-century Italy's masterpieces. Painter Cennino Cennini's 14th-century treatise, _Il libro dell' Arte_, is the most important reference for tempera techniques, still used today. By the 16th century, oil paint was almost always the medium of choice, because it allowed for much richer (and subtler variations of) color and a more forgiving working technique, as tempera dries very quickly. The 19th century witnessed a renewal of interest in painting with tempera, particularly in Britain, due to the rediscovery of Cennini's work, and there remain various contemporary painters who choose to work in the medium for its unique qualities, constraints, and historical resonance."

    "description": "Perhaps the earliest technique for creating three-dimensional forms or decoration, carving is the act of shaping, marking, or decorating wood, stone, or other materials by cutting or incising—as opposed to sculpting by building up a material like clay. Michelangelo once characterized carving as the process of revealing the shape inherent within a solid mass, penetrating the material to find the image within. Examples of carving can be found in ancient objects the world over, from paleolithic objects decorated with animal forms found in France to Shang dynasty oracle bones incised with ancient writing from China, and classical Greek Caryatid figures still standing today on the Acropolis. Even thousands of years ago, artists like the anonymous sculptor of a voluptuous 10th-century Yogini from India experimented with the ability of carved imagery to operate in both two and three dimensions, creating dramatic volume in contrast to flat space. To this day, carving continues to take forms both minute and monumental, from virtuosic carved sculptures to paintings incised for texture."

Pioneered by the [Post-Impressionist](/gene/post-impressionism) painter [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne) in the late 19th century, this technique typically involves the use of parallel repeating brushwork of uniform size to create angled planes that break down the contours that seem to define two-dimensional forms. The technique appears to flatten three-dimensional space, drawing attention to painting’s two-dimensional, material nature. Cézanne’s approach fueled many modern painting styles that emerged in the twentieth century, most notably [Cubism](/gene/cubism), which expanded upon the modular quality of his compositions (both [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and [Henri Matisse](/artist/henri-matisse) referred to Cézanne as the “father of us all”). While Cézanne’s highly structured paintings still captured ephemeral moments in atmospheric compositions, [American Modernists](/gene/american-modernism) like [Max Weber](/artist/max-weber) and [Marsden Hartley](/artist/marsden-hartley) used passage to create their own versions of experimental, compressed three-dimensional spaces and objects."

While its counterpart, [linear perspective](/gene/emphasis-on-linear-perspective), is used to render a sense of depth in a painting or drawing, straight-on perspective makes images appear flat; objects remain on the picture’s surface rather than recede into the background. This composition is most often employed by architectural photographers, such as pioneering documentarians [Bernd and Hilla Becher](/artist/bernd-and-hilla-becher), who captured frontal views of industrial buildings in order to convey a sense of the camera’s neutrality. Their influence can be seen in the work of their student, [Düsseldorf photographer](/gene/dusseldorf-school-of-photography) [Andreas Gursky](/artist/andreas-gursky), who digitally stitches multiple shots together to create photographs that, from afar, appear flattened and nearly abstract."

    "description": "Before the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century, to distribute the likeness of a work of art, artists resorted to copying. A common practice in multiple historical periods across nations, artists closely reproduced, sometimes verbatim, esteemed works of art or pieces deemed iconic in order to make them more portable, pay homage to their original creator, or to learn from them. Pre-modern Chinese artists, for example, reproduced paintings of earlier masters as an integral part of their learning process, to proclaim their artistic lineage, or to perpetuate older works created with ephemeral materials. Notably, [ancient Roman](/gene/roman-art-and-architecture) artists produced an unprecedented number of statues that took after [Greek sculpture](/gene/greek-art-and-architecture). The cultural and artistic agency behind these emulations often far exceeded the restrictive meaning of a “copy,” the term art historians have used to describe these works. For example, in Roman art, emulations allowed for statues to be more efficiently produced and distributed so that their meanings could become standardized."

Between the 16th and 19th centuries, a large number works of ancient Greek and Roman art were restored to look vastly different from their original appearance. Most characteristically, surviving pigment was scrubbed from recovered, previously [multicolored statuary](/gene/polychrome-sculpture) during the Renaissance and Neoclassical periods to satisfy the taste for white marble, creating a lasting false impression of classical sculpture as unadorned and monochromatic. In medieval art, portable objects were often refitted, at times after being dismembered, in new settings in an effort to embellish the display of a revered object or give it a new function entirely. Buildings have also often been altered to assume new functions, as with the conversion of numerous churches into mosques, most notably the Hagia Sophia, following the Ottoman occupation of Byzantine Constantinople in 1453."

Incredibly prolific, Picasso adapted his aesthetic over time. His most characteristic style, however, and the one most often adopted by others, is [Cubism](/gene/cubism), a technique that depicts people or objects by breaking them into various planes. Picasso later drew on these principles while employing bright colors and curvilinear forms, flattening his figures to create striking portraits with seemingly distorted facial features. It is nearly impossible to catalogue the myriad ways that artists have created stylistically similar works: in the 1910s, artists like [Albert Gleizes](/artist/albert-gleizes) and [Jean Metzinger](/artist/jean-metzinger) adapted Picasso’s mature Cubist style. When Picasso joined the French Communist Party in 1944, many leftist artists of the time, such as [Renato Guttuso](/artist/renato-guttuso) and André Fougeron adopted his classical style of the 1920s to address the devastation of World War II or to create politicized images.

Named after the medieval Bauhütten, or masons’ lodges, and inspired by the ideas of John Ruskin and William Morris, the Bauhaus is best known for reintroducing workshop training in lieu of traditional studio art education; unifying artistic creativity and manufacturing; emphasizing functionalism in architecture; and revolutionizing streamlined industrial design. After the closure of the Bauhaus, many former students and teachers fled the Nazi dictatorship, spreading the tenets of the school to many parts of the world. [Josef Albers](/artist/josef-albers), for example, helped to mold the fledgling graphic design program at Yale while [Laszlo-Moholy Nagy](/artist/laszlo-moholy-nagy) founded the Institute of Design at IIT in Chicago, often dubbed the “New Bauhaus,” where a generation of prominent American photographers—from [Aaron Siskind](/artist/aaron-siskind) to [Harry Callahan](/artist/harry-callahan)—imparted new vigor to experiments in modernist photography. The so-called “Ulm Bauhaus” (Ulm School of Design, Germany) operated from 1953-1968 under the direction of former Bauhaus student [Max Bill](/artist/max-bill), and its innovative curriculum in design education remains influential even today."

Instead, Picasso and Braque created more conceptual, subjective paintings that sought to represent the underlying structure of existence. The best-known Cubist works look like shattered glass in dim browns and yellows, and are composed of various sharp planes that combine to form people or objects. Cubism took its name from an insult delivered by the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who commented that one of Braque’s paintings looked as if it were “full of little cubes.” After 1910, Picasso and Braque’s Cubism was quickly adopted by many other artists in Paris and beyond and ended up being the primary influence on most or all abstract art before the outbreak of World War II."

[Rineke Dijkstra](/artist/rineke-dijkstra)’s stark and luminous large-scale portraits capture solitary subjects whose direct, unselfconscious gazes penetrate the picture plane, while [Sally Mann](/artist/sally-mann) employs early photographic processes to create delicately intimate portraits that often reveal imperfections characteristic of old cameras and printing techniques. [Philip-Lorca diCorcia](/artist/philip-lorca-dicorcia) uses both digital and Polaroid cameras to generate a wide range of portraits, from staged scenes filled with psychological tension, to documentary portrayals of pedestrians on city streets.

After a long period of isolation, Japan resumed trade with the West in 1853, and Japanese goods soon began to pour into Europe. Japanese objects were especially fashionable in Paris and London, and the term Japonisme was coined in 1872 by Parisian critic Phillippe Burty, whose vast collection of Japanese artworks drew the attention of [Edgar Degas](/artist/edgar-degas) and numerous Impressionists. Japanese aesthetics, as exemplified by _Ukiyo-e_ (\"Pictures of the Floating World\"), inspired asymmetric compositions, flattened modeling, calligraphic brushstrokes, pure bright colors, and the representation of transient, everyday scenes. These tendencies are visible in works of [Mary Cassatt](/artist/mary-cassatt), as well as Nabis painters [Pierre Bonnard](/artist/pierre-bonnard) and [Édouard Vuillard](/artist/edouard-vuillard); [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec) was inspired by Kabuki theatre prints, while [Paul Gauguin](/artist/paul-gauguin) adapted Japanese woodcut techniques.

The transcendentalist sensibilities of [John La Farge](/artist/john-la-farge), [George Inness](/artist/george-inness), and [James Abbott McNeill Whistler](/artist/james-abbott-mcneill-whistler) were key to the style’s development and wide popularity.

After the First World War, the utopian and spiritual elements of this tendency gave way to the more political ideas of groups like the Dresden Secession and the Novembergruppe, many of whose members later became associated with [Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity)](/gene/neue-sachlichkeit). Expressionism was a lightning-rod issue for Communists and National Socialists alike, for whom it often became a stand-in for Modern art at large.

In 1967 the English artist [Richard Long](/artist/richard-long) walked up and down a stretch of meadow over and over, creating a visible path depicted in the photograph _A Line Made by Walking_. This understated meditation on the symmetry and grace of a simple landscape contrasts with Land Art works that seek to dramatically alter a site, such as [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson)’s well-known 1970 sculpture and film, _Spiral Jetty_, which uses 7,000 tons of basalt, boulders, mud, and salt crystals mined from the area around Rozel Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, to form a massive spiral winding 450 meters from the lake shore.

Recent scholarship on Minimalism, however, has argued for its embeddedness in the politics of its day: the use of industrial materials, such as steel and Plexiglas, spoke to American military-industrial prowess, while repeated modular elements conjured a consumer society of replication.

Closely tied to Germany’s [Group Zero](/gene/group-zero), the Nul Group called for the end of personal expression in art, instead favoring pragmatism and objectivity. The group believed that art making was akin to manufacturing—the idea behind the work was primary, while the construction process was almost irrelevant. Its works, which were frequently monochromatic and composed of repeated forms, often contained found objects like steel bolts and matchboxes. The group disbanded in 1966 when its artists began to develop their own individual styles."

This term somehow attacked both sides: It made Socialist Realism look ridiculous, and did the same to the possibility of Capitalist Realism as well.” —[Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter)_\n\nCapitalist Realism was launched in 1963 in Germany by the artists [Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter), [Sigmar Polke](/artist/sigmar-polke), and Konrad Lueg (later to become the dealer Konrad Fischer) not as a movement, but rather as a send-up. Its most iconic expression was a performance titled “Living with Pop – A Demonstration for Capitalist Realism,” orchestrated by Richter and Lueg in the Berges department store in Dusseldorf that same year. The artists invited patrons to come view “what is hailed in America as the greatest breakthrough in art since Cubism,” as an advertisement for the event proclaimed. Puzzled visitors arrived to find the artists making themselves at home in a staged and decidedly average living room (Richter was reading a mystery novel). Of course Capitalist Realism had no such reputation in the U.S.; the artists were parodying the overnight ascendance of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art), with its celebrity culture and embrace of everyday commodities, as well as the German craze for all things American. Against the backdrop of the Cold War and a divided Germany, the fake movement’s title also alluded to the Soviet doctrine of [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism). The concerns of so-called Capitalist Realism—heavy-handed irony, investigation of the political aspects of consumerism, and critique of popular culture—have been seen by some as predecessors to a German strain of Pop Art, though the existence thereof is, itself, debatable."

Although not as widely practiced, artists such as [Arthur Wesley Dow](https://www.artsy.net/artist/arthur-wesley-dow) and [Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt](https://www.artsy.net/artist/bror-julius-olsson-nordfeldt) experimented with [woodcut](https://www.artsy.net/gene/woodcut-and-linocut) techniques, inspired by the influx of Japanese color woodblock prints imported to the United States. Japanese-American artist Chiura Obata’s “[World Landscape Series: America](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/chiura-obata-setting-sun-on-sacramento-valley-california)” (1930) employed traditional woodcut techniques to render modernist takes on iconic California landscapes."

Everyone was willing to be creative.\" —[Lygia Pape](/artist/lygia-pape)_\n\nNeo-Concrete Art was established in response to [Concrete Art](/gene/concrete-art), which emphasized the use of planes and colors to convey objective scientific principles. The Swiss artist Max Bill, a major exponent of Concrete Art, had significant exhibitions in São Paulo, Brazil in the early 1950s, inspiring a younger generation of artists there. In 1959, the _Neo-Concrete Manifesto_ was written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro—including [Lygia Clark](/artist/lygia-clark), [Hélio Oiticica](/artist/helio-oiticica), and Lygia Pape—who shared a similar interest in abstract forms and the use of color but wanted to insert poetic, and sometimes political, meaning and a greater sense of freedom and flexibility into their work. The merging of art and life was crucial: painting was to be removed from its frame, sculpture taken down from its pedestal, and the work constantly subject to re-invention by its viewers. This led to developments in participatory and immersive art, as exemplified by Oiticica's penetrable environments and wearable sculptures or Pape's envisioning of a world without words in _Book of Creation_. The critic Ronaldo Brito called Neo-Concrete Art a \"rupture\" in Brazilian art history, one that would inspire later generations of artists in Brazil, including those practicing under the repressive military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985."

The more helpless they are, the more instructive are the examples they furnish us.” —Paul Klee_\n\nIn the early 20th century, artists like [Paul Klee](/artist/paul-klee) attempted to reform art's staid conventions of beauty by returning to supposed primal or elementary beginnings. The art of children or those with mental disorders, which Klee championed and mimicked in his own work, seemed to offer access to authentic experience, unaffected by the trappings of civilization. Since then, many artists have attempted to present ostensibly unmediated expressions of creativity by eschewing traditional painting technique, a strategy that can be called “faux naïf”, derived from the French for “falsely naïve”. In contemporary practice, artists like [Tal R](/artist/tal-r) and [Jules de Balincourt](/artist/jules-de-balincourt) seek to address the modernist search for authenticity by adopting a child-like style."

Advanced in 1968 as envisioning an art that “speaks directly to the needs and aspirations of Black America” by poet Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) and writer Larry Neal, the Black Arts Movement urged the reinforcement of such mantras as “Black is beautiful” and James Brown’s “Say It Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud” in the form of a recognizable iconography. For example, Jae Jarrell created [_Urban Wall Suit_](/artwork/jae-jarrell-urban-wall-suit) (1969), a multicolored suit crafted to appear as a graffiti-covered brick wall and a walking sign of the public voice. Iconic images of activists such as [Bob Marley](/tag/bob-marley), Angela Davis, and [Malcolm X](/tag/malcolm-x) pervaded art and popular culture at this time, as did other symbols like the raised fist, Afro hairstyle, and vivid graphic patterns inspired by art and textiles of the [African Diaspora](/gene/african-diaspora).

Rejecting the academic tradition typically promoted in British art schools, he encouraged students’ discovery of [Mughal art](/gene/mughal-art)—art produced under the Mughal empire in Southern Asia between 1526 and 1857—a curriculum that was vehemently protested by the faculty, students, and press. With the young painter Abanindranath Tagore, Havell went on to spearhead a nationalist and modern art movement that celebrated historical, spiritual, and artistic Indian traditions.

While this claim oversimplifies, it is true that by the 17th century, Ukiyo-e printmakers innovated centuries-old woodblock text printing techniques to create colorful picture prints that were distributed widely for popular consumption. Some of the greatest Japanese artists of their time—[Ando Hiroshige](/artist/utagawa-hiroshige-ando-hiroshige), [Katsushika Hokusai](/artist/katsushika-hokusai), [Utagawa Toyokuni III](/artist/utagawa-toyokuni-iii-utagawa-kunisada), and [Keisai Eisen](/artist/keisai-eisen) among them—became known primarily as woodblock print designers in the Ukiyo-e style. In the 19th century, Ukiyo-e printmakers also began to focus on landscape, creating series such as Hokusai’s famed _Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji_. Ukiyo-e also had a profound impact on European artists around this time—its flattened perspective and innovative compositions inspired artists such as [Mary Cassatt](/artist/mary-cassatt), [Vincent Van Gogh](/artist/vincent-van-gogh), and [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec), as well as the [Japonisme](/gene/japonisme) movement in art and design."

    "description": "In his 1993 essay “Black to the Future,” cultural critic Mark Dery coined the term Afrofuturism to describe the cross-cultural philosophy of artists, musicians, and writers who drew on the techno-utopian thinking of the space age to reimagine Black life in the United States. Equally indebted to mythologies of the [African Diaspora](/gene/african-diaspora), Afrofuturism is not an artistic style but an approach to the intersections of race and technology that aims to visualize the future. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, musicians (Sun Ra, Grace Jones, and Parliament Funkadelic), authors (Octavia Butler), and visual artists ([Renee Cox](/artist/renee-cox)) drew upon the futuristic energy of science fiction, seeing outer space as an escape from the oppressive social and political climate of the Vietnam war and post–Civil Rights era. Afrofuturism’s engagement with the African Diaspora is wide-ranging: photojournalist Cristina de Middel took the failed 1964 Zambian space program as the subject of her 2012 series [_Afronaut_](/artwork/cristina-de-middel-bambuit-from-the-series-the-afronauts). Other artists have employed cyborgs, robots, and aliens as alter-egos to access alternative identities, such as Kenyan-American artist [Wangechi Mutu](/artist/wangechi-mutu); others have addressed the habitable space of the cosmos, as in [Kerry James Marshall](/artist/kerry-james-marshall)’s _Keeping the Culture_ or [Sanford Biggers](/artist/sanford-biggers)’s psychedelic quilts referencing cosmological maps."

While it espoused no common style, the group is characterized by its experimental and eclectic approaches, including forms of modernist [abstraction](/gene/abstract-art) that were neither common nor expected among African American artists at the time. A major point of contention among the group was whether artists should illustrate the black experience in [figurative terms](/gene/figurative-art), or if black abstraction itself was a politically radical form of artistic practice. While short-lived, the Spiral Group ignited important debates about philosophy, creative integrity, and artistic freedoms among black artists—and for the cultural community’s role in social change more broadly—during a time when few art critics were asking the same questions."

Led by photographers [Kansuke Yamamoto](/artist/kansuke-yamamoto) and Hiroshi Hamaya, Japanese photography of the 1920s and 1930s was largely shaped by the emergence of documentary photography in the United States and by established strains of Western [Pictorialism](/gene/pictorialism) and [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism). Post–World War II Japanese photography was dominated by street photographers [Daido Moriyama](/artist/daido-moriyama), Osamu Kanemura, and Yakuma Nakahir, who used handheld cameras to capture the frenzied claustrophobia of daily life in urban Japan. Such photographers pursued a new photographic form, termed _sunappu shotto_ (“[snapshot](/gene/snapshot-aesthetic”), which was characterized by the aesthetics of rough, blurred, and out of focus images. As photography galleries arrived relatively late to Japan, photography magazines like _Camera Mainichi_, _Asahi Camera_, and most famously _PROVOKE_, as well the medium of the photobook, were integral to the medium’s development and popularity. Other significant figures in post-war and contemporary Japanese photography include [Hiroshi Sugimoto](/artist/hiroshi-sugimoto), [Nobuyoshi Araki](/artist/nobuyoshi-araki), and [Hiroshi Masaki](/artist/hiroshi-masaki)."

Historically, landscape photography’s rise coincides with the period of [American westward](/gene/the-american-west) expansion during the late 19th century, when photographers joined government survey teams and railroad companies to document the vast expanse of nature before them. In contrast to today’s conditions, these intrepid documentarians carried heavy equipment and transportable darkrooms to process photographs on site. Notable examples include [Carleton E.

Expressionist art was often characterized by spontaneous brushwork or mark-making, distorted figures, a progression towards abstraction, and a concentration on forms and ideas borrowed from myths and so-called “primitive art.” In reaction to the shock of urbanization and the machine age, many of these artists attempted to convey psychological states of isolation and alienation, or sought refuge in the idea of a spiritual art. In Vienna, [Egon Schiele](/artist/egon-schiele) created unsettling, sinuous portraits that evoked the anxiety of the age; in Germany, the formal experiments of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky) combined new forms and color combinations with a focus on mysticism and expression; and in the field of architecture, Bruno Taut translated the utopian ideals of the tendency into fantastic buildings."

Many of these artists also drew inspiration from [Mexican muralism](/gene/mexican-muralism) and [pre-Columbian art](/gene/pre-columbian-art). In 1990, an important traveling exhibition of Chicano artists, “Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation,” opened at Wight Gallery at the University of California, Los Angeles. As stated by the exhibition’s advisory committee: “Chicano art is the modern, ongoing expression of the long-term cultural, economic, and political struggle of the Mexicano people within the United States. It is an affirmation of the complex identity and vitality of the Chicano People. Chicano art arises from and is shaped by our experiences in the Americas.” Central to the movement is the concept of “rasquachismo” (from _rasquache_, Spanish for poor), which refers to an attitude of resourcefulness and “making do,” which may refer to using [commonly available materials](/gene/use-of-common-materials), drawing on communities, or even sampling from other art movements or postmodern theories."

Prioritizing draftsmanship over painting, the school taught students to employ fine line work and soft, blended shading in their drawings. [Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres](/artist/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres)’s drawings, such as his portrait of [Mrs. Charles Badham](/artwork/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres-mrs-charles-badham), epitomize the Academic style, which is characterized by close attention to detail, near-invisible brushstrokes, and an emphasis on realistic modeling and shading. Academic painters often depicted scenes from history, literature, the Bible, or classical mythology, although this style can also be seen in pastoral scenes, such as [William-Adolphe Bouguereau](/artist/william-adolphe-bouguereau)’s _[Gardeuse de moutons (The Shepherdess)](/artwork/william-adolphe-bouguereau-gardeuse-de-moutons-the-shepherdess)_, and in [Orientalist](/gene/orientalism) imagery, such as [Jean-Léon Gérôme](/artist/jean-leon-gerome)’s painting _[The Snake Charmer](/artwork/jean-leon-gerome-the-snake-charmer)_.

The practitioners of _Shin-hanga_ retained many of the favorite subjects and traditional compositions of _ukiyo-e_, including [landscapes](/gene/landscapes), kabuki actors, and beautiful women, but also responded to [Impressionist](/gene/impressionism) painting and photography with their increased attention to light, mood, and optical perspective.

The return to traditional subjects and workshop production methods—both rejected by the contemporaneous _Sōsaku-hanga_ (“creative prints”) movement—was partly an attempt to counter the rapid changes to Japanese culture that followed the opening of Japan to the West in 1868."

After the fall of the Roman Empire, landscape motifs were largely absent from European art until the 14th century, but they flourished in Asia, particularly in the mist-shrouded mountains and visions of untamed nature of Song Dynasty (10th-13th century China) ink paintings. In European art since the [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance), artists and theorists have debated whether landscapes should depict “real” or “ideal” views of the natural world.

Artists have long been associated with radical political activity; [Jacques-Louis David](/artist/jacques-louis-david)'s involvement in the French Revolution is an often-cited example. During the 20th century, the [Mexican Mural School](/gene/mexican-muralism) was associated with the country's 1910 revolution and continued its legacy through images of working class liberation. And American and European artists during and since the 1960s have created a multitude of antiwar and socially-engaged artworks. Their practices—as well as those of artists outside America and Europe—continue to inspire contemporary artists, as politically-engaged art is one of the most prominent types of work being created today."

    "description": "The word “kitsch” originated in the 19th century to criticize art seen as being in poor taste, or which hopelessly copied “high art” but remained mediocre or lacking in refinement. In the 20th century, with the rise of industrial manufacturing, the term has become more generally associated with mass commodities or cheap entertainment, considered decorative or evocative of lowbrow taste. Kitsch suffered its most serious intellectual blow in art circles when Clement Greenberg railed against it in a famous 1939 essay, in which he claimed it anathema to progressive, avant-garde art since it pandered to the masses. The rise of consumerism in the United States and Europe in the 1950s and '60s generated an artistic interest in popular culture, however, often with an eye towards dismantling the divide between ostensibly “fine art” and mass appeal; nowhere was this more notable than with the rise of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) in the United States. Today, the idea that something can be “so bad it’s good” is so common that the term “kitsch” no longer retains the negative associations it once did, and artists today often create works that embrace bad taste and question the high- and lowbrow division in art. Importantly, while kitsch is generally associated with European or American culture, it has parallels throughout the world. For example, the concept of kawaii—or cuteness—in Japanese culture is a quality opposed to the aesthetic ideal of refinement and plays a prominent role in popular culture and entertainment."

    "description": "The fragile boundary between death and life has been a subject of art since the earliest recorded cultures. In Classical sculpture, scenes of death ranged from highly dramatic mythological scenes to the deeply introspective last moments of mortal subjects. On a more intimate scale, the pietà (Mary mourning of the body of Christ) became a commonly painted and sculpted subject beginning in the 13th century in Northern Europe; it soon spread to the south, and continued to appear regularly into the 17th century. The vanitas image, a reflection on the transitory nature of human existence that includes memento mori like skulls or hourglasses, was popularized in 17th-century Netherlands. From the 18th to the 19th centuries, French painting saw a shift from the admiring scenes of mortal struggle by [Romantics](/gene/romanticism) to sedate scenes by Realists, such as Gustave Courbet’s [_Burial at Ornans_](/artwork/gustave-courbet-the-burial-at-ornans). In 20th century Western art, reflections on mortality range from scenes of brutal atrocity (e.g. [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)’s _Guernica_) to the self-destructing machines of [Jean Tinguely](/artist/jean-tinguely), to homages to the victims of AIDS (by [Nan Goldin](/artist/nan-goldin) and [Felix Gonzalez-Torres](/artist/felix-gonzalez-torres), amongst others)."

In Western Art, depictions of food date back to funerary paintings of food offerings in ancient Egypt. The Classical historian Pliny claimed that Greek painter Zeuxis once painted grapes so realistic that birds came to pick at them. Depictions continued in [Roman art](/gene/roman-art), where the putto (male infant) depicted with grape vines was a common motif.

The ancient Greeks established the imitation of nature as the highest aim of art, and Chinese artists dating from the earliest dynasties have turned to the mountainous landscape as the physical manifestation of _Qi_, the vital energy of the universe. Many major movements of the intervening centuries have been defined by their increasingly subjective treatment of nature. The sweeping [Romantic](/gene/romanticism) landscapes of [J.M.W.

Racism, which sociologist Howard Winant defines as “that which creates or reproduces hierarchical social structures based on essentialized racial categories,” has fueled unthinkable violations of human life. Race, ethnicity and visual culture are inextricably linked, and visual art presents a rich site for artists to actively overturn racist imagery. Artists have drawn on their own racial identities to create ennobling depictions of historically marginalized individuals, such as the detailed portraits of African American individuals and families by [Charles White](/artist/charles-white). In the wake of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and the rise of [Pop art](/gene/pop-art), [David Hammons](/artist/david-hammons) and [Betye Saar](/artist/betye-saar) blended the materials and images of racist caricatures into a darkly parodic surrealism, while [Jimmie Durham](/artist/jimmie-durham) investigated Native American stereotypes.

Such ideas were applied to art beginning in the 15th century. For example, [Leon Battista Alberti](/artist/leon-battista-alberti)'s architectural designs made explicit reference to musical harmony and employed ratios that he thought would produce consonances. This type of practice became widespread in Renaissance architecture and soon found a place in investigations of linear perspective in drawing and painting, such as in the work of [Leonardo da Vinci](/artist/leonardo-da-vinci). Music was essential to early forays into abstraction at the beginning of the 20th century, as it served as an ideal starting point for emotive, non-representational compositions such as those of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky), [Paul Klee](/artist/paul-klee), and [Francis Picabia](/artist/francis-picabia), all of whom were part of artistic and intellectual communities that included musicians.

In subsequent years, artists took different routes to capture the events: some tried to encapsulate all of the action of a conflict into one image, while others used panels to create a sequential view of events. The early 16th century saw a new focus on portraits of soldiers, with German artists favoring a more closely observed and realistic style than their Italian counterparts. The 17th century saw the rise of war paintings lacking a hero, as well as the advent of some of the first seemingly antiwar works, such as [Jacques Callot](/artist/jacques-callot)'s _Misères de la Guerre_ (1633). [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism), for its part, gave birth to the highly dramatic war scene, and the 19th century saw more and more artists concerned with the casualties and suffering of military and war—[Francisco de Goya](/artist/francisco-de-goya)'s _Third of May (1808)_ and [Édouard Manet](/artist/edouard-manet)'s series on the execution of Maximilian are some of the most iconic examples.

Whether as an attempt at objective or documentary truth or to express the power and prestige (or idea) of a person, individual portraits examine what it means to be human and an individual. Classical Greek portraiture was concerned with formal, ideal beauty rather than documentary truth. The Renaissance and a renewed interest in humanism established the great portrait tradition, which would pervade Europe for the next three hundred years, dominated by [Raphael](/artist/raphael) in Rome and [Titian](/artist/titian) in Venice. Individual portraits were also often commissioned by monarchs to reinforce and display royal might: [Hans Holbein](/artist/hans-holbein-the-younger)’s famous portrait of Henry VIII is a quintessential example of the portrait’s power to flatter and play to a sitter’s vanity. Likewise, portraits played a vital role in displaying and mirroring the material wealth of the growing merchant class in the Dutch golden age, as in the work of [Frans Hals](/artist/frans-hals) or [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn). The invention of photography in the mid 1800s caused the portrait tradition to rapidly change; the newfound ability to capture an individual “as they were” meant that the painted portrait could no longer be taken for granted. Many variations in the photographic portrait resulted as did the exploration of how abstract painting might still make a portrait.

Much more recently, text has played a central role in modern and contemporary movements: [Georges Braque](/artist/georges-braque)'s Cubist paintings featured words tucked between lines of fractured geometry, while [Roy Lichtenstein](/artist/roy-lichtenstein)'s cartoonish [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) paintings often contained quote bubbles. Conceptual art up to the present has made heavy use of texts, as seen in [Joseph Kosuth](/artist/joseph-kosuth)'s dictionary definitions, [Jenny Holzer](/artist/jenny-holzer)'s \"truisms\", and [Lawrence Weiner](/artist/lawrence-weiner)'s wall pieces."

Iconic [Land Art](/gene/land-art) projects by [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson) and [Christo and Jean-Claude](/artist/christo-and-jeanne-claude) were both celebrated for creating new spaces and audiences and critiqued for the damage they often inflicted on their environments. Perhaps in response, artists of succeeding generations have sought to explore the relationship between humans and the environment without damaging the latter. This is illustrated in such works as [Richard Long](/artist/richard-long)'s walks through remote territories and [Andy Goldsworthy](/artist/andy-goldsworthy-2)'s ephemeral sculptures in nature. In 1982, [Joseph Beuys](/artist/joseph-beuys) initiated the planting of 7,000 oak trees throughout Kassel, Germany, as his contribution to “Documenta 7.” Contemporary artworks often use documentation to raise awareness of human-caused environmental degradation, as seen in photography by [Edward Burtynsky](/artist/edward-burtynsky) and [Richard Misrach](/artist/richard-misrach), and in research-driven investigations of the systems governing social and natural ecologies, as in the work of [Mark Dion](/artist/mark-dion). In the era of global climate change, new terminology sheds light on shifting priorities; scientists have proposed the term Anthropocene for the current epoch in which human activity impacts every ecosystem on the planet, and “Eco Art” is gaining currency as a term to describe art that furthers ecological sustainability or takes the form of environmental activism."

While the interactive sculpture did not render a person’s face or body, it has been interpreted as a portrait representing the ideal weight of the artist’s partner who died of complications from AIDS that same year.

In the 20th century, artists turned to addressing the form and content of messages distributed by mass media, particularly television.

Greek mythology, concerned largely with the lives of gods and heroic humans, has origins in oral tradition but was recorded by poets such as Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides. Roman mythology, which borrowed heavily from Greek predecessors, often dealt with myths of origin, social institutions, and human destiny; key poets included Virgil and Ovid and central stories include those of the She-Wolf of the Capitoline and the Rape of the Sabine Women. Mythological narratives were represented widely in Greek and Roman art, particularly in pottery, sculpture, and mosaics. The allegorical power of the widely known stories remained long after the decline of associated pagan religions, and overlaps between pagan and Christian imagery are visible in the tombs of the earliest Christians. While classical imagery was largely dormant in the Medieval period, it returned in full force in iconic Renaissance paintings and sculptures by the likes of [Botticelli](/artist/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli), [Titian](/artist/tiziano-vecellio-called-titian), and [Raphael](/artist/raphael-raffaello-sanzio-da-urbino) in Italy and [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) in Germany, all of whom sought to reconcile Christian piety with Classical thought. Subsequent painters who dealt regularly with classical themes included [Peter Paul Rubens](/artist/peter-paul-rubens) and [Nicolas Poussin](/artist/nicolas-poussin), and in 17th- and 18th-century academic painting, the use of classical stories was an esteemed technique.

Related to caricature, parody is a narrative or literary device—as opposed to a type of visual depiction—that imitates an original work or set of conventions while distorting it to comic, satirical or critical effect. In Western art, parody can be traced back to ancient Greek drama, while caricature is generally considered to have emerged out of 16th-century carnivalesque culture and grotesque disfigurations of the human figure. Over the course of the late-18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the United States, caricatures circulated in the press and pamphlets often delivered pointed political or social commentary. [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), considered the father of English caricature, made light of English social mores in his paintings and prints of the late 1700s, and by the 1830s in France a publication devoted entirely to the form, _La Caricature_, provided a forum for [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier)’s political drawings. These modes—in particular parody—have been of interest to late-20th-century artists in part because of their prevalence in culture at large, as the popularity of the mockumentary, satirical sketch comedy, lampoons, and spoofs attests."

The preparation of studies was later central to the practices of French academic painters and [Neoclassicists](/gene/neoclassicism).

The concept of trauma as personal struggle, however, became foundational in Greek mythology, with the trials and tribulations of a hero lying at the heart of Greek tragic drama. Medieval Christian art developed the motif known as the “Man of Sorrows”—a wounded and bloodied Christ figure, bearing a crown of thorns and a sorrowful expression—as an evocative reminder of suffering, meant to invoke devotion on the part of the viewer. In the 20th century, artists have been less concerned with the connection of pain to spiritual redemption, and more with the emotional and psychological toll exacted by violence, injury, suffering, or war. Iconic examples include [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)’s  _Guernica_ and works by [Otto Dix](/artist/otto-dix). World War II and the Holocaust had a profound impact on art; [Christian Boltanski](/artist/christian-boltanski) and [Anselm Kiefer](/artist/anselm-kiefer), for example, developed different modes of representation to respond to the traumatic nature of those events.

In 1916 the linguist Ferdinand Saussure proposed that the form a language takes is arbitrary and unrelated to its meaning. A decade later, the French writer Henri Michaux explored these ideas in asemic writing—writing that resembles natural language but conveys no meaning. Since then, artists have developed personal systems of pictograms and glyphs with varying degrees of legibility and idiosyncrasy, often to explore a wide range of concepts. In the 1960s, for example, [A.R. Penck](/artist/ar-penck) drew inspiration from cybernetics, the study of systems, to derive a hieroglyphic-like system of signs, which he used to represent societal and metaphysical relationships. In the 1980s, [Gu Wenda](/artist/wenda-gu) developed a system of meaningless ideograms that resemble traditional [Chinese calligraphy](/gene/east-asian-calligraphy).

Personified figures are often named after the concept that they represent.

Retaining their prominence in art of medieval Europe, personifications also appeared extensively in allegorical works of the European [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) and [Baroque](/gene/baroque) period. The allegories of these periods are often composed of personified figures and symbols that visually reference antiquity to invoke classical ideals and, therefore, universal principles. However, personifications aren’t necessarily classicizing in terms of style, as seen in [Artemesia Gentilleschi](/artist/artemisia-gentileschi)’s _Self Portrait as the Allegory of Painting_.

Most visual representations of this science take the form of illustrations and diagrams that often blur distinctions between science and art. This can be seen in the rich tradition of Persian medical illustration or in the medical diagrams of historic Chinese texts. Renaissance artists, most famously Leonardo da Vinci, also demonstrated a scientific interest in the human body; Da Vinci created anatomical sketches from autopsies he performed himself. One of the most influential books on anatomy, Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica, published in Basel in 1543, contains lavish woodcut illustrations attributed to the workshop of Titian, highlighting art’s primary role in communicating truth and scientific knowledge during the Renaissance; it was at this time that the study of anatomy became foundational in artistic apprenticeship. Contemporary artists have used anatomy and anatomical drawing to interrogate scientific knowledge or to comment on the powerful relationship between humans and nature. While most medical anatomies in world history have centered on the male body as the universal human form, the anatomy of the female genitalia has been used to represent femininity and female power, from abstracted prehistoric figurines depicting goddesses of fertility to the provocative use of vaginal imagery by feminist artist [Judy Chicago](https://www.artsy.net/artist/judy-chicago) in such works as Rejection Breakthrough Drawing (1974)."

The term was eventually used to describe backlit images, such as figures or objects in front of a sunset or in a window or a doorway.

    "description": "The robust art market of the 1980s was devastated in the wake of a stock market crash in 1987 and a severe recession in the early '90s. As a result, at the beginning of the decade, artists tended to look more outside the art world for their subject matter, which ranged from current issues such as the AIDS crisis, gun control, and homelessness to often-charged explorations of class, race, gender and sexual identity. This coincided with an emerging notion of artist as a kind of ethnographer, as well as an exploration of broken or grotesque bodies and identities, by the likes of [Paul McCarthy](/artist/paul-mccarthy) and [Kiki Smith](/artist/kiki-smith). The most recognized movement of the decade, the [Young British Artists (YBAs)](/gene/young-british-artists-yba), rose to international recognition through ambitious and provocative works such as [Rachel Whiteread](/artist/rachel-whiteread)'s _House_ and [Damien Hirst](/artist/damien-hirst)'s formaldehyde-encased animals, highlighted in the exhibition, \"Sensation\". In the 1990s, video art became more and more influential, especially due to works like [Matthew Barney](/artist/matthew-barney)'s _Cremaster Cycle_ and large-scale video installations by artists such as [Doug Aitken](/artist/doug-aitken). Concurrently, artists (like [Andreas Gursky](/artist/andreas-gursky) and [Jeff Wall](/artist/jeff-wall)) used the increasingly sophisticated tools of photo-manipulation to blur the lines of fact and fiction (or make a more perfect reality)."

    "description": "The 17th century was marked by increasingly robust global networks of trade, which brought a great deal of exchange of artistic objects and the global spread of styles. This was facilitated by British and Dutch trading companies in South Asia, the trade routes of the Ottoman Empire, and the Spanish administration of South America, amongst many other channels. China, Japan and Korea each experienced dramatic economic expansion and artistic flourishing, but while Chinese goods travelled widely through the global market, Japan maintained a closed economy. The great variety of artistic production in Europe in the 17th century is often loosely grouped under the term “[Baroque](/gene/baroque)”, which in general terms is characterized by a heightened sense of movement and lighting in compositions. In painting, these elements were perhaps first mastered by Caravaggio, who heavily influenced artists across Europe; amongst these were [Diego Velázquez](/artist/diego-velazquez) in Spain and and [Rembrandt](/artist/rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-1) in Holland. The exuberance of Baroque aesthetics combined with the fervor of the Catholic Counter-Reformation is evident in the re-constructed St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, a project which was seen to completion by [Gian Lorenzo Bernini](/artist/gian-lorenzo-bernini). The taste for Baroque art travelled to the Americas, as evidenced by ornate religious buildings most notably in Mexico and Peru. In France, the century witnessed the consolidation of power under absolute monarchy, whose decadence was made visible in the construction of Louis XIV's royal palace at Versailles; the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture was also established under his rule. In the Dutch Republic, whose independence was gained from Spain after 80 years of conflict, an affluent mercantile class created the conditions for a dynamic art market with a preference for portraits, still lifes, cityscapes, and scenes of everyday life."

The 18th century English painter [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth) developed an aesthetic theory around this so-called “Line of Beauty”, declaring it the liveliest of shapes, and included a depiction of it, carved in wood, in his self portrait of 1745. Important instances of curvilinear forms in the modern period include Brazilian architect [Oscar Niemeyer'](/artist/oscar-niemeyer)s sensuously curved futuristic buildings cast in concrete, and Frank Lloyd Wright's Solomon R.

One such technique was particularly striking, turning the world on its head, sometimes literally: the extreme angle. Taken upside-down, from the ground up (what Rodchenko, himself a pioneer of experimental photography, called a \"worm's eye view\"), from the sky (aerial views or \"bird's eye views\"), tilted (sometimes called the \"Batman angle\"), or rotated, photographs can enable us to see the world anew. Such techniques have also been employed—both before and after the advent of photography—by painters, in particular contemporary artists who use photographic source material to show aspects of everyday life from unexpected viewpoints. [Jenny Saville](/artist/jenny-saville), for example, depicts the female figure up-close and from beneath, disorienting the viewer, while [Marilyn Minter](/artist/marilyn-minter) zooms in on individual body parts and accessories from a tilted angle, producing glamorous, off-kilter images with photorealistic precision."

Its meaning in other aesthetic traditions is less clear (some art historians argue that it should only be used to describe Islamic art). Starting in the late Renaissance in Europe, it was used nearly interchangeably with the terms “[grotesque](/gene/grotesque)” and “moresque” to describe complex, curvilinear patterning.

Artificial ruins were among the more popular follies (ornamental buildings or architectural elements) of lavish 16th- and 17th-century European estates; a ruin in the vein of antiquity signified taste, as in [Gian Lorenzo Bernini](/artist/gian-lorenzo-bernini)’s bridge ruin (ca. 1630) at the Palazzo Barberini, in Rome. Examples from contemporary art include [Anselm Kiefer](/artist/anselm-kiefer), who uses charred and deconstructed materials to evoke the dark, mythic qualities of German culture in large-format history paintings. Artist [Daniel Arsham](/artist/daniel-arsham), inspired by his childhood memories of the destruction of Hurricane Andrew in 1991, casts obsolete electronics out of geological materials, while [Sterling Ruby](/artist/sterling-ruby)’s rough-hewn monumental sculptures made of ceramics and bronze resemble exhumed objects."

    "description": "“…all hierarchical distinctions have been, literally, exhausted and invalidated.”—Clement Greenberg\n \nThe term “all-over picture” was first used by art critic Greenberg in his 1948 essay “The Crisis of the Easel Picture” to describe the emergence of “decentralized” compositions like [Jackson Pollock’s](t/artist/jackson-pollock) tangled layers of dripped paint or [Mark Tobey’s](/artist/mark-tobey) dense [calligraphies](/gene/personal-writing-systems) that extend to the edge of a canvas. Works in this category lack a dominant focal point due to the uniform treatment of the entire surface. Contemporary artists like [Mark Bradford](/artist/mark-bradford) and [Dan Colen](/artist/dan-colen) have modernized this technique by covering every inch of traditional support mediums with unorthodox materials like discarded ephemera or chewing gum."

[George Nakashima](/artist/george-nakashima)’s famous “free edge” furniture, such as the “[conoid coffee table](/artwork/george-nakashima-conoid-coffee-table)”, are iconic examples; the edges of the table reveal the rough edges of American black walnut while the smooth, planar surfaces show just how the material can be transformed by cutting and polishing wood to highlight the grain."

    "gene name": "Wrapped",
    "description": "Wrapping an object inherently hides its features to produce a sense of mystery while simultaneously highlighting its surface and form, aesthetic effects that many artists have harnessed over the years. In the late 1950s, as artists began incorporating [everyday objects](/gene/found-objects) into their art, Bulgarian artist [Christo](/artist/christo) began wrapping furniture and household items with plastic, fabric, and rope. With his partner, [Jeanne Claude](/artist/christo-and-jeanne-claude), he expanded this practice in later decades, covering entire bridges, fields, buildings, and even islands with fabrics—inviting viewers to reconsider places they encountered daily but often overlooked. Operating with a similar intent, artists such as Magda Sayeg, Bill Davenport, and [Olek](/artist/olek) adopted a practice of “yarn bombing” in the 2000s. Intervening in and reclaiming public space, they wrapped common urban fixtures with brightly colored textiles, embracing an irreverence and spontaneity akin to that of [graffiti](/gene/graffiti-slash-street-art) and other forms of unsanctioned art."

    "gene name": "Contour Line",
    "description": "A contour line defines the outline of a form, as well as interior structure, without the use of shading. A fundamental basis of drawing, contour lines are usually the first technique children adopt to draw people, houses, and trees. A simple contour line can create a form with minimal embellishment while allowing for a range of line quality. A reliance on contour line shaped the style of [Ancient Greek](https://www.artsy.net/gene/greek-art-and-architecture) red figure vases, while figure studies from the [Renaissance](https://www.artsy.net/gene/renaissance), such as those of [Michelangelo Buonarroti](https://www.artsy.net/artist/michelangelo-buonarroti) and [Leonardo da Vinci](https://www.artsy.net/artist/leonardo-da-vinci), reveal clearly defined lines and naturalistic depictions of the human figure. Japanese [Ukiyo-e](https://www.artsy.net/gene/ukiyo-e) prints, with their strong emphasis on flat planes of color delineated by dark lines, such as those by [Kitagawa Utamaro](https://www.artsy.net/artist/kitagawa-utamaro), influenced the drawings and prints of European artists in the 18th and 19th centuries; these artists played with contour lines to create expressionistic visions of the human body, reflecting their interest in motion, mood, and subjective forms. In works by [Edgar Degas](https://www.artsy.net/artist/edgar-degas), [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec) and [Egon Schiele](https://www.artsy.net/artist/egon-schiele), the contour line shows its mutability, becoming sinuous, angular, heavy, faint—sometimes all within the same work. Today, [comics, cartoons](https://www.artsy.net/gene/comic-slash-cartoon), manga, and anime, which now incorporate both hand-drawn and computer-generated lines, carry on the tradition of emphasizing contour lines."

    "gene name": "Abstract Illusionism",
    "description": "In the mid-1970s, art critic Barbara Rose identified a trend in painting in which abstract works were rendered with a sense of perspective, depth, and shadow. Rose named this development Abstract Illusionism, calling attention to the fact that painting, albeit still abstract, was returning to its long history of depicting space. This was a notable shift following the prominence of [post-painterly abstraction](/gene/post-painterly-abstraction) in the 1960s, famously championed by art critic Clement Greenberg, which emphasized the flatness of the painting support. Rose’s term has been linked to [Frank Stella](/artist/frank-stella), [Jules Olitski](/artist/jules-olitski), [Walter Darby Bannard](/artist/walter-darby-bannard), [Ronald Davis](/artist/ronald-davis), and [James Havard](/artist/james-havard), who combine elements of [Abstract Expressionism](/gene/abstract-expressionism) and [hard-edge abstraction](/gene/hard-edged-1) with [trompe-l’oeil](/gene/trompe-loeil) effects. Many artists since have incorporated tropes of Abstract Illusionism, producing works with an array of abstract marks and shapes that appear to exist within three-dimensional space, as in the paintings of contemporary artists [Trudy Benson](/artist/trudy-benson) and [Josh Reames](/artist/josh-reames)."

As a general technique of composing an image of semi-regularized “units,” divisionism has had a rich, varied afterlife, from [Giacomo Balla](/artist/giacomo-balla)’s carets of vivid color and [Roy Lichtenstein](/artist/roy-lichtenstein)’s replication of the newspaper printing technique of benday dots, to [Chuck Close](/artist/chuck-close)’s gridded portraits and the near-sculptural application of [Suh Jeong Min](/artist/suh-jeong/min)."

Several artists purposefully incorporate cracks in their work, often to denote conflict, decay, or renewal, as with [Alberto Burri](/artist/alberto-burri)’s modern use of “craquelure,” the aged cracking of oil painting, to create landscape-like patterns. Other examples include [Marcel Broodthaers](/artist/marcel-broodthaers), who used discarded eggshells in his work to signify birth, and [Doris Salcedo](/artist/doris-salcedo/works), who cracked open the floor of the Tate Turbine Hall as a comment on racism and colonialism."

    "description": "Painters, sculptors, and architects have engaged with balance in their works to present forms that have a tenuous distribution of weight, threatening to become unstable by outside forces. Many of [Richard Serra’s](/artist/richard-serra) monumental steel sculptures present a precarious sense of balance in an effort to explore the physical and psychological effects of space. His _One–Ton Prop (House of Cards)_ (1969), for example, consists of four heavy plates leaning against each other, supported by nothing but pressure. Other artists, like [Alexander Calder](/artist/alexander-calder), use balance to achieve the floating, kinetic effects of his suspended mobiles, such as in _Triumphant Red_ (1959-1965). More figuratively, photographer [Michael O’Neill](/artist/michael-oneill) studies tension and balance by portraying bodies in movement and yoga postures."

[Jeff Zimmerman](https://www.artsy.net/artist/jeff-zimmerman), for example, replicates natural crystals he has discovered in the wild in glass sculptures and design objects. The use of these natural forms can also allude to [environmental concerns](https://www.artsy.net/gene/the-environment) about the changing climate and earth’s uncertain future. To represent the all-encompassing effects of pollution, [Liz Hickok](https://www.artsy.net/artist/liz-hickok) constructs and photographs small environments that are slowly engulfed by growing crystals. In a work that similarly incorporates [chance](https://www.artsy.net/gene/chance), [Jeremy Everett](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/jeremy-everett-untitled-centrefold) submerges books and newspapers in chemicals to create crystalline clusters. These striking works symbolize the [decay](https://www.artsy.net/gene/decay) of the manmade and a return to a natural state."
